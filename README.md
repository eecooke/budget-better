Tools to visualize personal spending habits.

The main file is a Jupyter Notebook that acts as a dashboard for building graphs based on a personal transaction history.

The motivation behind this project is to automate some of my personal record keeping and inform the creation of a monthly budget.

Provides the functionality to:
- View and maintain transaction history
- Visualize categorical trends in spending
- Specify a budget and compare monthly expenses
